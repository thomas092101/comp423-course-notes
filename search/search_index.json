Rust uses its own dependency to manage program called <code>cargo</code>. In order to create a new file in our dev container with Rust, you want to run the command <code>cargo new</code> followed by a file name of your choosing.  We also want to use the flag <code>--vcs none</code> to avoid auto creating a new git repository.  </li> </ul> <p>Helper</p> <p>Using the <code>cargo new</code> command will create a new repository automatically which is a helpful feature when starting new projects.  Lucky for us, Cargo also automatically builds the Hello World! program for us.  </p> <p>Running <code>cargo new &lt;filename&gt;</code> prompts rust to create a directory of the same filename along with a <code>main.rs</code> inside a <code>src</code> directory. After creating your <code>hello_world</code> file, navigate to main and check out the code that was generated. The code inside should loosely resemble a Hello World! program from java or C.  We will want to edit the code slightly to make the program say \"Hello COMP423\" instead of \"Hello World!\". You should also edit the filename to reflect this change. </p> <ul> <li>Compiling and Running your program   To compile programs in Rust, you should first navigate inside the src file that was created, then run <code>cargo build</code>. <pre><code>cd hello_comp423/src  \ncargo build  \n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>You may notice that running <code>cargo build</code> produces a bunch of files. These are all the necessary dependencies and libraries needed to run your compiled code, along with a binary file which is the code your machine will execute. Similar to C's gcc command making the necessary connections to shared libraries.  For now, we don't need to worry about these files.  </p> <ul> <li>Running the built file Now is the time to run our completed program. To run programs in Rust, we simply want run the following command. <pre><code>cargo run  \n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Compare</p> <p>It is possible to skip the <code>cargo build</code> command entirely.  If you do not run the build command, <code>cargo run</code> will automatically compile and run your code.</p> <p>Congratulations! You have coded your first Rust program inside a Dev Container! All that's left is to <code>exit</code> your container, commit and push your changes to GitHub.  </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#citations","title":"Citations","text":"<p>Rust Documentation Starting a Static Website Project with MkDocs Mkdocs Materials </p>"}]}
